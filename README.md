# Thesis- Emotion Recognition from Body Language using Deep Learning
Three machine learning models were developed.
CNN- Classify the emotions from each image frame.A combination of image datasets and video datasets were used. Each frames from the videoes were extracted. Then image augmentation were applied to balance and increase the datasets.
CNN+RNN/LSTM - only Video datasets were used to train, test and validate the model. The train, test and validation split was 80%, 10% and 10%. small sequences from the videoes with 20 frames were extracted. The videoes were augmented to balance and increase the dataset samples.
